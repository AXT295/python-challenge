# python-challenge

With this module, we are required to write a Python script that analyses the company's financial records in this challenge. This module is presented with a Financial_Databank, called Budget_Data.csv. The data set is comprise of two columns: Date and Profit or Loss. To calculate all of the following values, the task is to build a script that analyses the records.

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The next challenge will be to help mondernise the voting process in a small, rural town. Given a data set called election_data.csv. Three columns are included in the dataset: "Voters' ID", "County" and "Candidate". The job is to compile a Python script that analyses the votes and computes each of the following values.

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

I was able to pull out the same results as in the example with the help of the script I found here https://github.com/cantugabriela/Python-Challenge/tree/master/PyParagraph(Bonus), with the help of my uncle with his background in coding plus the help from ask-the-class on Slack.
